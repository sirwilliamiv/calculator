# Instructions

1. Create an HTML file that has two input fields to accept the two numbers to perform operations on.

2. Create 4 buttons to perform each of the basic mathematical functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

3. In your JavaScript, put an event listener on each of the buttons.

4. When the user performs one of the operations, output the result to another DOM element of your choice.
